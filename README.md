Sources for a [Medium article](https://vinnik-dmitry07.medium.com/a-python-unity-interface-with-zeromq-12720d6b7288).

## Tips:
* If you want to change Client component on MainCamera (e.g. ClientFastImg to ClientOneWay), run corresponding Python server script (server_fast_img -> server_oneway).
* Unity can freeze if you use two-way communication and stop the server before Unity scene.
